OpenFOAM is a popular open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework for a wide range of physics simulations. Here, we represent a methodology for automated OpenFOAM simulations for the simpleFoam coupled with particleFoam solver for simulation of drug delivery in idealised bifurcating vascular arteries. Bulk amount of simulations can be carried out in OpenFOAM with shell scripting in linux terminal, particularly if the user has access to high performance computing (HPC) resources. One important note is the mesh in our case was generated from ANYSYS Fluent, thus we use the fluentMeshToFoam command for creating the polyMesh directory. Please refer to the methodology.txt file for a detailed step by step guide.
